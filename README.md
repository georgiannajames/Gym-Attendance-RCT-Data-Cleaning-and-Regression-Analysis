## Summary

Within this repo, I perform a regression analysis of a fake RCT study on the effect of monetary incentives on gym attendence. Participants were "randomly assigned to treatment and control and reported the hours they attended the gym over a period of time, along with a few other variables including age, body mass index, and race.  

## Data

The analysis is performed entirely using the hoursatgymRCT.csv dataset found in the data folder within this repo. This data was artificially generated to practice data cleaning and regression analysis. 


## For Reproducing

For those wishing to reproduce this analysis, simply run the rmd and knit it.
